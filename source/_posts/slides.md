This page is for the AAAI 2019 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03806">"adversarial attack and detection under the Fisher information metric"</a>.
The paper has been designated for oral representation on the conference. For the following period of time, as the first author of the paper, I will be preparing for the conference.

The main purpose of this slides is to serve as the complementary material for the paper. As required by the AAAI paper formatting guideline, the paper is not allowed to exceed 8 pages long with the last page only containing references. Additional fee (hundreds of dollars) would be required for more pages in the publication. I have to remove some technical details to satisfy the requirement. However, I have to acknowledge that some of the details are essential for further understanding. As a matter of fact, some questions mentioned in the slide are raised by the reviewers, and have been thoroughly discussed during the reviewing, which really helps a lot to make the paper stronger.

Hopefully the slide can address most concerns of readers.
