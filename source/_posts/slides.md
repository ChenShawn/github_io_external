This page is specific for the AAAI 2019 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03806">"adversarial attack and detection under the Fisher information metric"</a>.
The paper has been designated for oral representation on the conference. For the following period of time, as the first author of the paper, I will be preparing for the conference. The presentation slide will always be <a href="./slides.pdf" id="slider">publically avalable here</a> as long as this personal blog is maintained.

The content of the slide, generally speaking, actually goes far beyond a 12 minutes representation with 3 minutes Q&A time. I will consider removing some not-so-important pages for AAAI 2019, whereas the slide publically avalible here will always be the full version.

The main purpose is that I would like to use the slide as complementary material for the paper. As required by the AAAI paper formatting guideline, the paper is not allowed to exceed 8 pages long with the last page only containing references. Additional fee (hundreds of dollars) would be required for more pages in the publication. ~~而我只是一介穷逼小硕.~~ As a result, I have to remove some technical details to satisfy the requirement. However, I have to acknowledge that some of the details are essential for further understanding. As a matter of fact, some questions mentioned in the slide are raised by the reviewers, and have been thoroughly discussed during the reviewing, which really helps a lot to make the paper stronger.

Hopefully the slide can address most concerns of readers.

The idea of this paper is originated from my study of the reinforcement learning course "trust region policy gradient". I was particularly interested in the strong theoretical foundation of information geometry. I read the references listed in the paper, made the experiments, finished the first version of the paper by May 18th, and submitted the paper to NIPS 2018.

~~结果当然是被NIPS审稿人吊打.~~

It happened that Prof Fletcher, the second author of the paper, has visited China during that period of time. He is a very nice person with great enthusiasm and specialist knowledge in mathematics and computer science. He helped me figure out some mathemetical background of the paper, and I was really inspired a lot from him. 

**Here I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof Fletcher. Thank you!**

After submitting the paper to AAAI 2019, I have been working in Baidu Shanghai as an intern. The working is pretty heavy there, leaving me with no time to reorganize my codes from a mess of jupyter notebooks. I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. I hope I can have the time to make the codes available on github in the next few months.

Looking back on the past year, my emotion is very complicated. Inevitably, I mixed much personal emotion when writing the summary now. This paper is my first attempt on academic research. I have improved a lot from the experience, going together with surprise, anxiety, disappointment, frustration, and finally, hope.

Thank you all.
